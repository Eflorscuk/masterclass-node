# MASTERCLASS NODE
## GOALS
In this project, we aimed to review the Node runtime using its main modules.

The project is dividided into:

1. stats.js = Here we created an application to show free memory, 
total memory and memory usage percentage on terminal.

2. logger.js = An application for creating logs was later integrated
with the Stats.js application. 

3. http = HTTP module review.

4. API = Creation and integration of an API with Frontend. 
We aimed to create an application that could save favorite urls in a JSON file.
